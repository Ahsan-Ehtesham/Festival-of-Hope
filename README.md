## Fruit Festival (Hackathon of Hope with Celo)

<b>Theme Focused: Public Good / SocialFi</b>

The project aims to assist hardworking farmers (fruit farming) in achieving a profitable harvest.

Overview:-

Farmers can register their unique NFT fruits by describing their characteristics.<br/>
Users contribute to these NFTs by donating on the platform.<br/>
Farmers return the yield to donors (stakers) based on the amount raised by the harvest. The harvest reward is represented as ERC721, but in reality it would be ETH, etc.

### Tech Used:

Solidity: for the smart contract<br/>
Truffle ERC721: we use the ERC721 template for a faster development of smart contract<br/>
NEXT JS, Bootstrap,  Web3: NEXT JS for the frontend, Bootstrap and Web3 to connect to blockchain.
